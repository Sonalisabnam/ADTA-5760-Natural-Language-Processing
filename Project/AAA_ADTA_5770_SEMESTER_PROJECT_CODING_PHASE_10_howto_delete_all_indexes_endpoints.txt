#----------- ADTA 57770: SEMESTER PROJECT: PHASE 10: UN-DEPLOY INDEXES AND DELETE ALL INDEXES & ENDPOINTS


# IMPORTANT NOTES: 
# THE CODE IN THIS FILE IS ONLY USED WITH THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS
# --) The code of all phases of the semester project is included in ONLY ONE Jupyter Notebook document
# --) In other words, the developer complete all phases (1 - 10) in one notebook.

# IMPORTANT NOTES: 
# --) The develop have completed coding PHASE 1, 2, and 3 and run the code correctly before starting the code in this file


#---- PHASE 10: STEP 1: Verify the list of currently existing end points

# Get the list of end points that have been created

list_end_points = aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndexEndpoint.list()

print(f"List of indexes: {list_end_points}")


#---- PHASE 10: STEP 2: Look for and take notes of numeric end point IDs
# Look for the string of text starting with "resource name"
# Look for a number (long sequence of digits) at the end of the string of text starting with "resource name"
# Copy or take note that number: It is the numeric ID of an end point.
# Copy or take note that number: It is the numeric ID of all end points displayed in the results of listing

# ...

#---- PHASE 10: STEP 3: UNDEPLOYED indexes and DELETE ALL end points

# GET end points
del_index_endpoint_1 = aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndexEndpoint("a numeric ID of some end point")
del_index_endpoint_2 = aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndexEndpoint("a numeric ID of some end point")
del_index_endpoint_3 = aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndexEndpoint("a numeric ID of some end point")
# ... Continue until getting all end points listed above

# Un-deploy indexes and delete end points
del_index_endpoint_1.undeploy_all()
del_index_endpoint_1.delete()

del_index_endpoint_2.undeploy_all()
del_index_endpoint_2.delete()

del_index_endpoint_3.undeploy_all()
del_index_endpoint_3.delete()

# ... Continue until un-deploying all indexes and delete all end points listed above


# Print out the list again to verify --> Should be empty: Nothing is printed out
list_end_points = aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndexEndpoint.list()

print(list_end_points)



#---- PHASE 10: STEP 4: Verify the list of currently existing indexes

# Get the list of indexes that have been created for the vector search system

list_indexes = aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndex.list()

print(f"List of indexes: {list_indexes}")


#---- PHASE 10: STEP 5: Look for and take notes of numeric index IDs
# Look for the string of text starting with "resource name"
# Look for a number (long sequence of digits) at the end of the string of text starting with "resource name"
# Copy or take note that number: It is the numeric ID of an index.
# Copy or take note that number: It is the numeric ID of all indexes displayed in the results of listing

# ...

#---- PHASE 10: STEP 6: DELETE ALL indexes

del_index_1 = aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndex("a numeric ID of some index")
del_index_2 = aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndex("a numeric ID of some index")
del_index_3 = aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndex("a numeric ID of some index")
# ... Continue to get all indexes

del_index_1.delete()
del_index_2.delete()
del_index_3.delete()
# ... Continue until deleting all indexes

# Verify that all indexes have been deleted --> The list should be empty: Nothing is printed out
list_indexes = aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndex.list()

print(list_indexes)


###========================= AT THIS POINT:
# All indexes have been un-deployed and deleted.
# All end points have been deleted

# COMPLETE SEMESTER PROJECT CODE: PHASE 10
